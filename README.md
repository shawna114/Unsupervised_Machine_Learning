# Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Objective:

Determine if cryptocurrencies on the trading market can be grouped to create a classification system.

## Requirements:

  1. Process raw data to fit the unsupervised machine learning models<br>
  2. Utilize several clustering algorithms to explore whether the cryptocurrencies can be grouped together with other similar cryptocurrencies<br>
  3. Use data visualization to share your findings

## Dimension Reduction Methods Utilized:

  1. PCA<br>
  2. TSNE

## K-Means Cluster Analysis:



## Determination:

1. No distinct clustering could be visualized for cryptocurrency
